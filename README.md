## 🌟 Executive Overview

InsureDesk CRM bridges the operational gap between insurance brokers, intermediaries, insurers, and end policyholders:

- **Lightning-Fast Policy Ingestion**: Automated extraction of complex schedule PDFs from India's top General and Health Insurers with 100% field accuracy (OD, TP, GST, Add-ons, NCBs, Hypothecation, Vehicle Specs).
- **Proactive Renewal Management**: Distinct renewal workflows isolated from primary business production figures, with automated renewal pipelines and customer follow-up alerts.
- **Auditable Financials & Production**: End-of-Day (EOD), Month-to-Date (MTD), Year-to-Date (YTD) production metrics, intermediary commissions, and branch reconciliations.
- **Omnichannel WhatsApp Gateway**: Instant policy delivery, automated birthday greetings with customized card rendering, and claim status alerts via a dedicated WhatsApp microservice.
- **Client Self-Service Portal**: Clean public interface for client policy lookup, document retrieval, and instant claim notifications.

### 1. 🤖 Intelligent Policy Ingestion (OCR & PDF Extraction)
- Multi-page PDF schedule parser with exact insurer matching and isolated category scoping.
- Instant extraction of vehicle details (Make, Model, Chassis, Engine, RTO, Body Type, Seating, Cubic Capacity, Manufacturing Year).

## 🎯 AI & Deterministic Policy Extraction Engine

Extraction rules are strictly isolated under `src/lib/policies/pdf/training/<insurer>/<category>.cjs` to ensure zero cross-insurer regressions:

| Insurer | Supported Categories | Extraction Highlights |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ICICI Lombard** | Motor (OD, Package), Health (Elevate) | Full add-on breakdown, TP policy cross-referencing, NCB validation |
| **HDFC ERGO** | Motor (Private Car, Commercial), Health (Optima Secure) | Package vs Net OD differentiation, CSC intermediary mapping |
| **IFFCO-TOKIO** | Motor (Commercial Signa, Two Wheeler, Private Car) | Dense GST table extraction, wrapped chassis/engine recovery |
| **The New India Assurance** | Motor (Commercial Liability, Private Car), Health | Schedule column merging resolution, comprehensive TP schedules |
| **Bajaj Allianz** | Motor (Commercial Liability, Drive Assure), Health | GSTIN, Hypothecation, Gross Vehicle Weight & Capacity |
| **Tata AIG** | Motor (Auto Secure), Health, Warehouse | Multi-schedule property parsing, Risk location extraction |
| **Care Health** | Health | Proposer relations, sum insured tiers, deductible mapping |
| **United India** | Motor, Health, Warehouse, Burglary | Non-motor line of business property and content schedules |
| **Go Digit** | Motor (Private Car, Commercial) | Fast digital schedule and covernote ingestion |
| **Royal Sundaram** | Motor | Layout-aware table and coverage extraction |

## 🛠️ Operational Scripts & CLI Tooling

InsureDesk CRM includes CLI utilities for database operations and audits:

### Move / Backdate Policy Record
Update a policy's saved date, uploaded file timestamp, and create an immutable audit record:
```bash
node scripts/move-policy-date.cjs <POLICY_NUMBER> <DD/MM/YYYY>
# Example:
node scripts/move-policy-date.cjs 3001/O/452859230/00/000 25/08/2026
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

Run the automated test suite across all training modules and extraction pipelines:

```bash
# Run all unit and PDF extraction tests
npm test

# Run extraction training isolation test suite
npx vitest run tests/extraction-training-isolation.test.js

# Run specific insurer extraction test suites
npx vitest run tests/icici-lombard-motor-training.test.js
npx vitest run tests/iffco-tokio-motor-extraction.test.js
npx vitest run tests/bajaj-allianz-motor-training.test.js
npx vitest run tests/hdfc-ergo-motor-extraction.test.js
npx vitest run tests/new-india-motor-extraction.test.js
```

## 🔒 Security & Architecture Constitution

- **Public vs CRM Separation**: Internal administrative routes (`/crm/*`) are strictly decoupled and never exposed on public-facing links or buttons.
- **Deterministic Training Isolation**: Extraction rules for an insurer/category cannot bleed into or mutate another scope.
- **Modal Centering & Backdrop Blur**: All dialog overlays render through `document.body` via `ModalPortal` with full vertical/horizontal centering and backdrop blur.
- **Data Safety First**: Original uploaded PDFs, document history, and audit trails are preserved immutably. Soft deletes and audit logs are enforced across all primary records.
